AngularGWT: Write Angular Controllers, Filters, Directives in GWT.

WARNING: Recommended that you use SuperDevMode develop, completely untested in DevMode. Uses lots of compiler casting 
magic to reduce code size, but is likely to break when running inside a JVM.

Currently undone: 

* Refactor project into library and samples.
* More JavaDoc.
* Unit tests.
* Transitive dependencies, modules that depend on modules.
* JSO wrappers for the rest of the AngularJs API. I only implemented that which was needed for TodoMVC.
